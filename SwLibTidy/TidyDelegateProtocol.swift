    Purpose
      This protocol defines the delegate methods that can be used with
      SwLibTidy. As a C library, LibTidy places a lot of emphasis on
      callbacks, but SwLibTidy provides this delegate interface as a more
      Cocoa-like alternative.

 This protocol describes an interface for Tidy to report on status and changes
 during certain operations. These methods, if implemented by your delegate,
 can serve as an alternative to closures and/or callbacks that are native to
 Tidy.
