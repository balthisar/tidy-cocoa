# Config

These files describe the correct configuration for each of the targets. There
are no build settings configured in the project file proper, although you are
free to set them to override the set configuration.

This approach is used to allow universal frameworks and dylibs for the
dependencies, as well as to document the configuration choices. Please have
a look at the files for more information.
