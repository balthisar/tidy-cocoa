// Although this is an Objective-C project, it seems that we need to have at
// least one Swift source file — even if blank — in order to import all of
// the Swift libraries needed to link with a Swift static library.
//
// I suspect that if I embedded the binaries to the static framework, or added
// library search paths, this might not be needed. But it's simple and works.
