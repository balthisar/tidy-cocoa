# Console Application

The console application is just a simple demonstration of using SwLibTidy for
non-GUI applications. It is _not_ intended to become a replacement for the real
**HTML Tidy**, and is missing all of the features that make the official Tidy
an indispensible tool.

## Bundle

Because of linking issues with the Swift Standard Library, this application has
been released in a bundle to ensure that it will always work anywhere you
install it. For convenience, simply create an alias or symbolic link to the
bundleâ€™s executable, whereever you want access to the tool.
